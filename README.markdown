# makiArcGISStyle	

This is a utility for converting Maki icons to an ArcGIS style.  It is used to update the ArcGIS styles in the main Maki repository https://github.com/mapbox/maki

In order to use the utility, the SVG sources must be converted to EMF.  See the .bat file for a simple way to do this with Inkscape.
